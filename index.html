							<h2>Nick Lang, President</h2>
							<p>Fourth Year, Game Design & Development Major</p>
							<p>I first began fighting games back in 2018. Despite never reading nor watching JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure (even to this day admittedly), I was still very interested in the series, and eventually came across an old Capcom Fighting game based on the story of part 3. JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future was the game that convinced me to get into fighting games, and I’ve put a lot of time into all sorts of titles, both recent and retro. As a very active member of the Rochester FGC, I hope to use my passion for fighting games to help make this club the best it can be.</p>

							<h2>Caleb Coplan, Vice President</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Computer Engineering Major</p>
							<p>I’ve been into fighting games for about 3 years now. In the midst of covid lockdowns, I was roped into Guilty Gear Strive by a handful of friends and I’ve dedicated myself to the craft since. During my first year I found RITFGC after my orientation week, and I’ve been locked in on that shit ever since. As an advocate for both low-tier and weird characters, the greatest thrill to me is overcoming whatever may be in your way, and doing it your way. No matter if you like throwing with Bottom 1 like me, or if you don’t hate yourself. It’s my goal to make sure everyone can enjoy fighting games the way they want to. </p>

							<h2>Jay Wong, Treasurer</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Game Design & Development Major</p>
							<p>I came to RIT as a big Smash Bros player and while I had played some other fighting games casually I rarely ever played anything except Melty Blood. On a whim one day I decided to check out the FGC club and had a blast just playing random different fighting games with everybody else. As an advocate for both low-tier and weird characters, I was never really competitive when it came to fighting games but, after a few weeks at the FGC, I began to enjoy coming back week after week to both play casuals and in brackets. The community here is welcoming for anybody looking to have fun and as an eboard member I hope to help this club prosper and grow for all its past and present members.</p>

							<h2>Max Smith, Secretary</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Mechatronics Engineering Technology Major</p>
							<p>Hi, my name is Max but you can call me bestbyak, every1 does. Jokes aside, I’ve been a big fan of fighting games for a long time. I would always watch them but never really played, as none of my friends liked them. When I came to RIT and saw the FGC club I knew it was the place for me, I’ve started playing the games I used to only watch and it has been a blast. Everyone here was incredibly friendly and welcoming to me, so my goal isn’t to make it what I already know it is; instead, my goal is to keep the club as amazing as it was when I joined and do my best to elevate it.</p>

							<h2>Gunnar Dickey, Social Media Manager</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Game Desgin & Development Major</p>
							<p>I got into fighting games a few months after Guilty Gear Strive’s release. I played Strive off and on before coming here, because I didn’t have any friends who played it. When I got here, I found the RITFGC during orientation week and decided to try it out. I managed to do alright in my first bracket, which was nice, but what kept me coming back was how welcoming and friendly the environment had been. I’ve never been much of a social person, but here I felt like I can talk to anyone and have a good time doing it. My favorite part was discovering and trying new games and the feeling of getting better as I learned them. My goal is to keep the club a place where people can enjoy themselves and try new games as well.

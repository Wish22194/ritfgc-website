							<p>Third Year, Game Design & Development Major</p>
							<p>I first began fighting games back in 2018. Despite never reading nor watching JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure (even to this day admittedly), I was still very interested in the series, and eventually came across an old Capcom Fighting game based on the story of part 3. JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future was the game that convinced me to get into fighting games, and I’ve put a lot of time into all sorts of titles, both recent and retro. As a very active member of the Rochester FGC, I hope to use my passion for fighting games to help make this club the best it can be.</p>

							<h2>Daniel Arcega, Vice President</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Computer Science Major</p>
							<p>My love of fighting game competition dates back to as far as i can remember, when my brother and I spent countless hours on Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. As the series progressed, I continued on with each new entry, but started to lose interest in the franchise around the end of high school. Seeking a new avenue of competition, I picked up Dragon Ball FighterZ on a whim due to my love of DB. It opened my eyes to the genre of anime fighters, though it would be a bit longer until I truly fell in love with the genre, thanks to Guilty Gear Strive (and Xrd!). This club has given me a wonderful place to grow as a player and person, and I Strive to return that support tenfold as VP.</p>

							<p>Fourth Year, Computer Science Major</p>
							<p>The one true queen of the RIT Fighting Game Community. I love zoning, chip damage, and not having an invincible reversal. My first fighting game was technically World Heroes Perfect, but the first one I got half decent at was BlazBlue Cross-Tag Battle. At RIT I was introduced to BlazBlue Centralfiction, which is now my main game, since it's the only one with Amane Nishiki. (Chronophantasma is not a real game) I'm always down to play something a little less popular, if only because they're cheaper; that's what I call good financial management.</p>

							<p>Second Year, Game Design & Development Major</p>
							<p>I came to RIT as a big Smash Bros player and while I had played some other fighting games casually I rarely ever played anything except Melty Blood. On a whim one day I decided to check out the FGC club and had a blast just playing random different fighting games with everybody else. As an advocate for both low-tier and weird characters, I was never really competitive when it came to fighting games but, after a few weeks at the FGC, I began to enjoy coming back week after week to both play casuals and in brackets. The community here is welcoming for anybody looking to have fun and as an eboard member I hope to help this club prosper and grow for all its past and present members.</p>

							<h2>Lucas French, Social Media Manager</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Software Engineering Major</p>
							<p>I started playing fighting games in high school with Street Fighter 2 and Guilty Gear. What first drew me into these games were the cool characters and flashy moves, but what kept me playing them was the thrill of playing with friends and the feeling I was slowly getting better with each match. So naturally when I came to RIT, I sought a community where I could play fighting games and the FGC club really was a place that embraced the parts of fighting games I loved the most. Since then, I’ve met so many awesome people through the club and played some really cool games. I hope that the FGC club can be as fulfilling of a place for you.</p>

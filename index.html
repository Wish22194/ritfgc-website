			<h3>THE CLUB</h3>
			<p>
				<em>We love fighting games!</em>
			</p>
			<p>We love to get together and play all types of fighting games. We meet Friday nights from 6pm to 12am in Institute Hall room 1140. Starting at 8pm, we run our weekly tournaments. This semester our staple games are Granblue Fantasy Versus, BlazBlue: Central Fiction, and Under Night In-Birth Exe: Late[clr]. We also have one more tournament that is a different game every week based on the community's interest. If tournaments aren't your thing or you are looking to just hang out, feel free to come and meet people and play some casual sets.</p>

							<h2>Anthony Pichardo, President</h2>
							<p>Fourth Year, Game Design and Development Major</p>
							<p>I came to Rochester when I was still new-ish to anime fighters. I had only played Guilty Gear for a few months, but quickly improved and became one of the leaders and better players in the Rochester anime FGC. As such, I was offered to join Team AGN as their anime fighting game specialist. While I wasn’t necessarily as heavily involved as Erik when it came to the transition, I was always available when needed. As well, my current standing in the community made me a natural fit for the role of president when the time came for our club to form. My main games are Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax: Ignition and BlazBlue: Central Fiction. I have top 8 finishes and commentary reels at majors in both games as well as Guilty Gear Xrd.</p>

							<h2>Nana Aidoo, Vice President</h2>
							<p>Third Year, New Interactive Media and Development Major</p>
							<p>I’ve been playing fighting games since I was in High School and I was first introduced to the scene when I met Anthony during my first year orientation. He then would introduce me to Erik, and the other fighting game players at RIT and I spent my first year getting to know them and the atmosphere they had.  At the end of last semester I was asked to take the role of Social Media Manager and I happily accepted. Since then, I've moved into the role of Vice President but you can always catch me either playing Tekken or Anime fighters so don’t hesitate to say hello.</p>

							<h2>Yash Bagri, Treasurer</h2>
							<p>Fourth Year, Game Design and Development Major</p>
							<p>I'm a habitual top tier player but refuse to be carried by my characters. Catch me losing to just about anyone the mashes enough buttons espeically if they play Guilty Gear Xrd, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[clr], or BlazBlue: Central Fiction. I'm a chronic anti-neutral player. My signature move is called the Yash Special where I wake up Burst Super in Xrd. I'm also known for dashing up and uppercutting into Rapid Cancel. I got into fighting games when I met my lord and savior, Erik. He pulled me from my endless night of FFXIV and into the world of fighting games. I don't know what I would do without him. I joined up as an interim vice president when Anthony was coop and they can't get rid of me.</p>

							<h2>Jackson Robbins, Secretary</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Computing Security Major</p>
							<p>I messed around with fighting games since early high school, but I finally started competing in my senior year with Street Fighter V. Coming to RIT, I was introduced to Erik, and we both would practice that game for hours on end. Now, I play literally any fighting game you put in front of me, be it 2D, 3D, anime, or in between. After playing with all the different fighting games, I want to be able to bring them all together and help them all enjoy fighting games together, so I pursued the role of vice president. You can find me playing nearly every game at the club, either teaching newer players the fundamentals or competing with more seasoned veterans, and if you can find a game I haven’t played yet, I hope you can bring it and show me the ropes!</p>

							<h2>Darius James, Social Media Manager</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Game Design and Development Major</p>
							<p>My name is Darius James, aka Lam, and I'm currently a 3rd year here at RIT. I got into fighting games just recently, over the past summer, and decided to find some people to play Under Night In-Birth with at a local level. I got a link to the FGC discord and everyone was instantly welcoming to me, I never felt out of place ever. The more I got into the community, the more I did. Eventually, Erik let me do some commentary when he couldn't and I just kept working on the streams every week, trying to help out as best I could. When the eboard told me they needed a Social Media Manager, I was in esports at the time and decided that this is where I wanted to go, and what I wanted to do, so I took the position. Now I work on streams every week and manage the social medias for the club.</p>
